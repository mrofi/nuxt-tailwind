- [Install Dependencies](#install-dependencies)
- [Run It!](#run-it)

<a name="clone-this-repository"></a>
## Clone This Repository
I have no time to make it as a npm package, so if you want to use it in your project folder, just clone this repo :
```
git clone git@github.com:mrofi/nuxt-tailwind.git <some-name>
```
next you have to install all dependencies

<a name="install-dependencies"></a>
## Install Dependencies
`cd` to your installation folder, then do :
```
npm install
```

<a name="run-it"></a>
## Run It!
Start your development server, run and go!
```
npm run dev
```
